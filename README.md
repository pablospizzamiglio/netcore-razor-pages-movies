# Get Started with Razor Pages

This repository contains my implementation of the [Get Started with Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio-code) tutorial from the .net core 2.2 official documentation.

It's a simple web application with some CRUD operations, using SQLite as a data store, Entity Framework to handle migrations and Bootstrap for the front-end.
