# Get Started with Razor Pages

This repository contains my implementation of the Get Started with Razor Pages from the .net core 2.2 tutorial section from the official documentation.

It's a simple web application with some CRUD operations, using SQLite as a data store, Entity Framework to handle migrations and Bootstrap for the front-end.
